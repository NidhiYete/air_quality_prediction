# Paavan Vayu - Air Quality Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Background
- Paavan Vayu is an air quality monitoring web application designed to provide real-time information about air pollution levels in specific locations. It aims to raise awareness about air quality issues and empower individuals to make informed decisions to protect their health and the environment.


## Approach to Implementation
- The project utilizes Streamlit, a Python framework for building interactive web applications, to create a user-friendly interface for accessing air quality data. It integrates with Supabase, a cloud-based service for app authentication and the security of user authentication data  information. Machine learning models are employed using python libraries to predict air quality levels based on air pollutant historical data and geographical data.

#### Project Planning and Requirements Gathering
- Comprehensive planning and requirements gathering.
- Defining project goals, identifying stakeholders, and understanding user needs.

#### Technology Selection 
- Selection of appropriate technologies and frameworks.
- Technologies such as Streamlit, Supabase, GitHub, and Python libraries were chosen.

#### System Design and Architecture
- Designing a scalable and reliable system architecture.
- Integration of components like the user interface, version control, and third party authentication services.

#### Iterative Development and Testing
- Continuous refinement based on user feedback and testing.
- Iterative approach with frequent iterations focusing on new features and bug fixes.
- Thorough testing including component testing, system testing, and requirement testing.

#### User Feedback and Iteration
- Collection of user feedback throughout the development process.
- Incorporation of feedback into subsequent iterations for continuous improvement.

#### Documentation and Training
- Creation of comprehensive documentation for developers and end-users.
- Provision of training materials and ongoing support as needed.

#### Launch and Post-launch Support
- Deployment of the application to production after thorough testing.
- Provision of post-launch support to address issues and ensure ongoing reliability.
